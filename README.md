I will give the tutorial (I suggest you use this code in [replit](https://replit.com/repls)

## #1 ┊ Uploading assets
You have to upload an image to be your rpc asset, upload it on [Discord Dev Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

📝 Assets cannot be edited, if you want to change the asset name, you must delete and re-upload the asset to your application

## #2 ┊ Setting up tokens

npm i discordrpcgenerator
```
