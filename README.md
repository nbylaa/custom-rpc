I will give the tutorial (I suggest you use this code in [replit](https://replit.com/repls)

## #1 ‚îä Uploading assets
You have to upload an image to be your rpc asset, upload it on [Discord Dev Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

üìù Assets cannot be edited, if you want to change the asset name, you must delete and re-upload the asset to your application

## #2 ‚îä Setting up tokens
To use this code, you must have your discord account token, want to know how? Please watch this [video](https://youtu.be/IVZzyjYyUkc)

## #3 ‚îä Installing the package
You only need 2 packages to make this rpc
```js
npm i discord.js-selfbot-v11
npm i discordrpcgenerator
```

## #4 ‚îä Start Making RPC
```js
const discord = require ("discord.js-selfbot-v11");
const rpc = require ("discordrpcgenerator");
```
You have to enter your token, twitch link and app id into the environment
```js
const { token, app_id, twitch } = process.env;
```
